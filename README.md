About program/game:

This is a C++ console-based tic-tac-toe game with an unbeatable CPU player. Game has 2 modes: single player and multiplayer.

In single player mode, the player goes against the CPU in a battle for highest score.
In multiplayer mode, two players are allowed to battle against each other for highest score.

Most of the program code is used up by CPU move logic.
NOTE: Not all unique and possible needed to be implemented - only the most important based on player choices and board analysis.

Game has been tested in both single player and multiplayer modes.

As of 12/30/19, no bugs have been found and game passed tests.

Game begins with a welcome message from which a main menu with options is displayed that allows a player(s) to begin match.
